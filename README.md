# untitled_shell

A simple shell with abstract syntax tree written in pure GNU C.

This project is not intended to be a full-featured shell, but rather a simple shell with a simple AST implementation. Many features are missing, and the code might crash or behave unexpectedly. Please use it as a learning resource only.

## Build

```bash
make
```

or

```bash
make dev
```

For verbose output and printing AST by default.

## Credits

[Abstract Syntax Tree: An Example in C](https://keleshev.com/abstract-syntax-tree-an-example-in-c/) for the nice example and base `Tagged union` AST implementation.
